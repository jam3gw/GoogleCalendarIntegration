# Google Calendar Integration

A Python script for retrieving Google Calendar events from the last 7 days.

## Features
- Authenticates with Google Calendar API using OAuth 2.0
- Retrieves calendar events from the last 7 days
- Formats and displays event information
- Handles both timed events and all-day events

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Google Cloud Platform account

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jam3gw/GoogleCalendarIntegration.git
   cd GoogleCalendarIntegration
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Authentication Setup

This application uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate with Google Calendar API and requires two key files:

#### credentials.json
This file identifies your application to Google and is required to start the authentication process.

**How to obtain credentials.json:**

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google Calendar API:
   - In the sidebar, navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Calendar API" and select it
   - Click "Enable"
4. Create OAuth credentials:
   - In the sidebar, navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" and select "OAuth client ID"
   - For Application type, select "Desktop application"
   - Enter a name for your OAuth client (e.g., "Google Calendar Integration")
   - Click "Create"
5. Download the credentials:
   - After creation, you'll see a modal with your client ID and client secret
   - Click the download button (JSON format)
   - Rename the downloaded file to `credentials.json`
   - Place it in the root directory of this project

#### token.json
This file is automatically generated when you first run the application and contains the user's authorization tokens.

- It's created after successful authentication with Google
- Stores access and refresh tokens to maintain your session
- Allows the application to access your calendar without re-authenticating each time
- **Security note**: Keep this file secure as it grants access to your Google Calendar data

## Usage
Run the script:
```
python get_calendar_events.py
```

For more advanced usage with additional options:
```
python calendar_api.py
```

To see examples of different ways to use the API:
```
python example.py
```

### First Run
On first run, the script will:
1. Open a browser window asking you to log in to your Google account
2. Request permission to access your calendar data
3. After authorization, retrieve and display your calendar events from the last 7 days
4. Save the authentication tokens to `token.json` for future use

### Subsequent Runs
The script will use the saved token for authentication without requiring you to log in again, unless the token has expired or been revoked.
